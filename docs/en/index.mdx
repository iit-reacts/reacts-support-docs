# Overview

## Introduction

Welcome to Reacts! Here you'll find a comprehensive information for integrating with the Reacts platform. We’ve tried to make this documentation user-friendly and example-filled

If you’re planning to use our API in Production, take a look at our [Privacy Notice](https://reacts.com/en/legal/privacy#openInNewTab) and [Terms of Use](https://reacts.com/en/legal/terms-and-conditions#openInNewTab).

## API protocols
The Reacts API uses HTTP POST/GET/PUT requests to communicate and HTTP response codes to indicate status and errors. All responses come in standard JSON. The Reacts API is served over HTTPS TLS v1.2+ to ensure data privacy; HTTP and HTTPS with TLS versions below 1.2 are not supported. All requests must include a Content-Type of application/json and the body must be valid JSON.

## Versioning

We periodically release new versions of our API. We try our best to minimize breaking changes. In the case where a breaking change is introduced you will be notified.
