title: How to prepare for my first video visit with my health professional using the Reacts application
---
A teleconsultation or video visit is a private, secure face-to-face appointment between you and your physician or other healthcare professional, on your smartphone, tablet or computer, at a specific time range. These are useful for follow-up appointments to discuss test results, review findings after a procedure or surgery, or address concerns that do not require a physical examination in the office. Consider this convenient option for your next follow-up, saving time and expenses.

The following instructions will allow you as a patient to prepare for your first Reacts video visit with your healthcare professional.

_Please note that Reacts is a secure and confidential application which meets the high standards of the healthcare industry. YOUR PERSONNAL INFORMATION WILL ALWAYS BE PROTECTED._

_If you want to learn more about our Privacy Notice, please read our documentation "Reacts - Privacy Notice"._

**To perform a virtual visit using Reacts, you will need:**

*   A computer, tablet, or a smart phone (Please read our documentation "System requirements" to learn more)
*   An internet connection (cellular, Wi-Fi, or wired)
*   A valid personal email address
*   A Reacts account (will be assigned to you by your professional)
*   The Reacts application – either the web or mobile version

* * *

Step 1: Getting invited to Reacts by your healthcare professional
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The first step in the process is for your healthcare professional to invite you by sending you a Reacts invitation by e-mail. You will need to provide a valid personal e-mail address to your professional to complete this step.

Step 2: Complete your Reacts account registration
-------------------------------------------------

You will then receive a Reacts email from your healthcare professional inviting you to join him or her on Reacts as a “Guest”.

Simply click the orange **_Join now_** button in the e-mail and you will be redirected to the Reacts website to complete your account registration.

Your first name, last name and email will be pre-filled based on the information provided by your healthcare provider, just create a password and confirm it (your password must be at least 8 characters, including at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one numeric character).

You will then need to review the Reacts Terms of Use and Privacy Notice.

Step 5: Be ready to join your virtual appointment with your professional
------------------------------------------------------------------------

You should know (ahead of time) the date and time your doctor and/or healthcare professional will contact you on Reacts.

A little before your scheduled session time, connect to the application, go to the “My appointments” section, and click on the button to join your virtual appointment. This will bring you to the virtual waiting room. As soon as your professional is ready, he/she will join you and you will see him/her appear on the screen. See tutorial below.

**VIDEO: How to join my virtual appointment on Reacts (https://youtu.be/2lXajrgvcDI)**

In some cases, the professional may tell you to connect to the application for a adhoc call at a pre-established time WITHOUT a scheduled virtual appointment. In such a case, just connect to the application at the agreed time. Just wait for the incoming call from your professional and answer it by clicking on the green icon as illustrated below.

**You will then be placed in a secure video call with your healthcare provider**.

If you experience technical issues, call your physician’s office.
