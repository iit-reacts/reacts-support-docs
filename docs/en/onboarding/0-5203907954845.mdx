Here are the steps to follow depending on your Reacts usage.

**I am using Reacts with Collaboration Live or Lumify:**

Please contact your Philips Sales representative, or use the “Contact Us” button on the product page ([Collaboration Live (https://www.philips.ca/healthcare/resources/landing/collaboration-live#form\_51957)](https://www.philips.ca/healthcare/resources/landing/collaboration-live#form_51957), [Lumify (https://www.philips.ca/healthcare/sites/lumify/ultrasound-realtime-collaboration#\_contact)](https://www.philips.ca/healthcare/sites/lumify/ultrasound-realtime-collaboration#_contact)), submit your information and we’ll contact you.

**I am using Reacts not integrated with a Philips Product:**

We do not offer Reacts outside Reacts with Collaboration Live and Lumify. Therefore, you will not be able to renew your subscription(s).
