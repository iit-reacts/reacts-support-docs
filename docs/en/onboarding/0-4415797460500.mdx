title: Getting started with your Reacts “Standard” subscription
---
The Reacts application will allow you to perform virtual video visits, secure messaging and file transfer, collaborate, and engage with your customers and colleagues in a simple and secure way.

Please note that Reacts is a secure and confidential HIPAA compliant application which meets the high standards of the healthcare industry. YOUR PERSONNAL INFORMATION WILL ALWAYS BE PROTECTED.

_If you want to learn more about our Privacy Notice, please read our documentation "Reacts - Privacy Notice"._

The instructions below are meant to be used as a “guide” to facilitate the onboarding process.

To perform virtual communications using Reacts, you will need:

*   A computer, tablet, or a smart phone (Please read our documentation "System requirements" to learn more)
*   An internet connection (cellular, Wi-Fi, or wired)
*   A valid personal or professional email address
*   A Reacts account (see below)
*   The Reacts application – either the web or mobile version

* * *

Step 1: Having a Reacts Standard subscription assigned to you by your organization
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first step in the process is for your organization to assign you a Reacts standard subscription. You will need to provide a valid personal or professional email address to your organization to complete this step.

* * *

Step 2: Complete your Reacts account registration
-------------------------------------------------

You will then receive a Reacts email from your organization with information about your Reacts subscription and instructions for creating your Reacts account.

Simply click the orange button **_Join now_** in the email and you will be redirected to the Reacts website to complete your account registration.

You will need to create a password and enter it twice (the password must consist of at least 8 characters, including at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one numeric character).

You will then need to review the Reacts “Term of use” and privacy notice.

To finalize your account creation, click on the blue “Create my account” button at the bottom of the page.

Once your Reacts account has been completed, you will receive an email confirming “Your account has been created”.

**Note:** If you don’t receive this confirmation email, check your email “spam” folder or contact your organization or Reacts customer support.
