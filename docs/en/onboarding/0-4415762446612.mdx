---
A Reacts “Pro” subscription will allow you to perform virtual video visits, communicate, collaborate, and engage with your patients and colleagues in a simple and secure way.

**Your Reacts Pro plan allows you to invite patients to join you on Reacts for free as “guests”.**

Please note that Reacts is a secure and confidential application which meets the high standards of the healthcare industry. YOUR PERSONNAL INFORMATION WILL ALWAYS BE PROTECTED.

_If you want to learn more about our Privacy Notice, please read our documentation "Reacts - Privacy Notice"._

**To perform virtual visits using Reacts, you will need:**

Step 5: Invite your patients on Reacts for your virtual consults and/or instant messaging
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**ATTENTION: There are DIFFERENT ways to invite your patients, depending on whether or not you want them to have access to you outside of a virtual appointment.**

**A-)** I only want to see my patient for his virtual appointment **and do NOT want the patient to be able to reach me on Reacts before or after his/her virtual visit:**

*   To invite your patients to a virtual appointment **WITHOUT** the patient being able to then contact you on Reacts before or after his/her appointment (i.e.: will not be able to send you a message or call you on Reacts), just use the virtual appointment feature in Reacts in the web version (using the Chrome browser).

**VIDEO: How to invite a patient to a virtual appointment and join it (https://youtu.be/WvZpiqsuWc0)**

**B-)** I want **my secretary or assistant to invite the patient for the virtual appointment** and **do NOT want the patient to be able to join me** on Reacts before or after their virtual visit:

*   In order to do this, your secretary or assistant must have a Pro subscription. They just have to go to the “My appointments” section of the application and schedule the appointment by inviting the patient (using his email) and you (from their contact list).

**VIDEO: See how an assistant can schedule a virtual appointment between a patient and a professional (https://youtu.be/jm8jEnhd2hE)**

**C-)** I want **my patient to be in my contact list** (i.e.: the patient could send me messages or call me on Reacts) and I can communicate with him/her by instant messaging or video call for his virtual appointment:

*   To communicate with a patient through Reacts and have him/her in your contact list, you must access the Reacts dashboard from a computer or mobile device and send them an invitation to join you as a Guest (registration as a Guest is free for the patient). See details below regarding how to invite a patient as a Guest.

INVITING GUESTS FROM A COMPUTER (REACTS WEB APP):

1\. Login to your Reacts account at reacts.com

2\. In the **_Contacts_** section, click on **_+Guest_**

![Guests.jpg](@assets/attachments/Guests.jpg)

This will bring you to the Reacts dashboard, where you can invite your guests and manage their subscriptions. Enter the name and email address of your patient and click on “Add”.

![2022-08-29_16-52-56.png](@assets/attachments/2022-08-29_16-52-56.png)

![2022-08-29_16-55-32.png](@assets/attachments/2022-08-29_16-55-32.png)

You will get a message confirming that your Reacts invitation has been sent; the status of the guest account will appear as “Pending” on your dashboard.

![Pending_Guest_EN.png](@assets/attachments/Pending_Guest_EN.png)

As soon as your guest has completed his/her Reacts account registration and accepted their subscription once logged in, you will see the status of their guest account change to “Accepted”. At any time, you can remove your guest’s access and invite new guests by clicking on the orange **_Add a guest_** button.

![Accepted_Guest_EN.png](@assets/attachments/Accepted_Guest_EN.png)

INVITING “GUESTS” FROM A MOBILE DEVICE:

1\. Go to reacts.com using a browser on your mobile device.

2\. Click on the menu button in the upper right of the page and then click on **_Log In_** to login to your Reacts account.

![Screen_A_EN.png](@assets/attachments/Screen_A_EN.png)

![Screen_B_EN.png](@assets/attachments/Screen_B_EN.png)

3\. Enter your e-mail and Reacts password to log in to the Reacts dashboard

![screen-C-1.jpg](@assets/attachments/screen-C-1.jpg)

4\. This will bring you to your Reacts dashboard, where you can invite your guests and manage their subscriptions by clicking on the **_Manage guests_** tab.

![screen-D-1.jpg](@assets/attachments/screen-D-1.jpg)

5\. Click on "Add a guest", enter your patient’s name and email address and click on **_Add_**.

![mceclip2.png](@assets/attachments/9437991119261)

![mceclip3.png](@assets/attachments/9437991761309)

6\. You will get a check mark confirming that your Reacts invitation has been sent.

![mceclip4.png](@assets/attachments/9437987106973)

The status of the guest account will be initially shown as “pending” on your dashboard. After your guest has completed his/her Reacts account registration and accepted their subscription once logged in, you will see the status of the account change to “active”. At any time, you can “unassign” your guest’s access.

![mceclip5.png](@assets/attachments/9438112011165)

7\. You can also invite new guests by clicking on the orange **_\+ INVITE GUEST_**  button.

8\. Once you have completed the Reacts guest invitation process, your patient will receive an email from Reacts advising them that you have assigned them a Reacts guest subscription (see below).

Patients will have to create their Reacts account by clicking the **_Join now_** button and accessing the application by downloading it or by accessing it through the web version on their computer. When they log in to their account for the first time, they will just need to accept your subscription and they will automatically see you in their “Contacts” list.­

### _\*For a smooth onboarding process with your patient, it is important that you advise them in advance that they will receive an email from Reacts inviting them to join you on the platform._

### _\*We recommend that you either refer the patient to our documentation “How to prepare for my first video visit with my health professional using the Reacts application" page OR that you refer them to your own personalized Reacts onboarding process created based on the template from our patient onboarding page._

**How to unassign a subscription to a patient so that he/she can no longer reach me:**

At any time, you can remove the patient from your contact list and your guest list by following these steps:

*   To unassign a subscription to a patient, just go to your Reacts dashboard, click the 3 dot menu, click on “Remove Guest”

![mceclip2.png](@assets/attachments/9434580488989)

![mceclip3.png](@assets/attachments/9434617509149)

Then simply click on DELETE to complete unassignment of the subscription.

![mceclip4.png](@assets/attachments/9434621148957)

The patient will be automatically removed from your contact list.

The patient will no longer be able to access you via Reacts. You can, however, re-invite them at any time via your dashboard or by creating a virtual appointment (see point A above)
