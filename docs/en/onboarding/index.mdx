Onboarding
==========================

Here are some basic recommendations before you get started with your virtual visits:

*   Telemedicine will not be for all patients. For technological or other reasons, some patients will not be good candidates for video consultations. Consultation by telephone may be preferable.
*   The web version must be accessed from the Chrome browser. ([download Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/))
*   Make sure you have the patient’s phone number as a “plan B” in case you experience technical problems during the video call. Also make sure the patient has a number to call if they have a question or problem.
*   If you are having your virtual consultations on a mobile device, make sure to connect your device to a power source since videoconferencing goes through mobile devices battery life quickly.
*   [The application tutorials are on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYwL2oeImCdPLMNvzKeFDzA). Some establishments block access to YouTube on their internal network. You may have to watch them on your personal device in such cases.
*   [Step by step guide to prepare your first use of the Reacts application]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link en/onboarding/0-4415762446612.md %}) and how to invite your patients

*   Here are some tutorials to help you discover the basic features in Reacts:

Problems receiving Reacts emails and problems with passwords
------------------------------------------------------------

1) I HAVEN’T RECEIVED MY REACTS ACTIVATION EMAIL

\- First check all your mailboxes, both professional and personal.

\- We used the correspondence address on record with your professional association.

\- Check your spam box.

2) STILL NOT RECEIVED: WRONG OR MISSING EMAIL

Please contact your organization

3) WISH TO CHANGE EMAIL ADDRESS

\- The email address serves as the unique identifier for the account.

\- Please contact your organization

4) I FORGOT MY PASSWORD

You just have to open the application and click on "Forgot your password?” below the sign-in box. You simply need to follow the instructions to reset your password.

5) I JUST RECEIVED THIS INVITATION ON MY PERSONAL EMAIL. AS I AM A SPECIALIST AND I INTEND TO CONTACT PATIENTS BY REACTS, I WOULD LIKE FOR MY PRO SUBSCRIPTION PAID FOR BY MY PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATION TO BE LINKED TO MY PROFESSIONAL EMAIL.

\- Your email address is not visible to other users on Reacts. The email is only used for registration, login and password management.

\- When users communicate with each other, only their Reacts identifier (i.e. username) is visible.

Technological issues and questions
----------------------------------

1) I DO NOT HAVE A WEBCAM ON MY COMPUTER, WHO SHOULD I CONTACT TO HAVE ONE?

The telehealth team associated with your organization.

2) CAN I USE REACTS ON BOTH MY MOBILE DEVICES AND PERSONAL COMPUTER?

Yes.
