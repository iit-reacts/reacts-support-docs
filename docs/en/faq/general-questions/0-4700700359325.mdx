---
In order to create a Reacts account, you need to receive an invitation from another Reacts user.

This invitation can be:  
- someone send you a contact request in Reacts (it will only give you a 30 day trial)
- someone assign you a PRO or standard subscription in Reacts
- someone invite you to an appointment (it will only give you a short term guest subscription)
- someone add you as an administrator of Reacts subscription. ( it will only give you a 30 day trial)

Once invited, you will receive a Reacts email to finish the creation of your account (please check your SPAM folder if you don't find it)
