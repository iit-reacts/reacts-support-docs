title: Why do I receive Reacts email New Instant Message from
---
If you are not logged into Reacts, you will receive a Reacts email if you receive an instant message in Reacts.

Please note that you will not receive one email per message. You will only receive one email per conversation per 30 mins.

For example : if your counterpart sends you several messages in the same conversation in the next 50 minutes while you are not connected to Reacts, you will receive 2 email notifications.
