Frequently asked questions
==========================

Here are the answers to the most common questions we get about our product.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

**DO I NEED TO HAVE SPECIAL EQUIPMENT TO USE REACTS (OTHER THAN THE BASIC WEBCAM, MICROPHONE AND SPEAKERS/HEADPHONES)?**

No.

Just make sure that your computer or tablet meet the minimum technical requirements. You will need a webcam, a microphone, and speakers (or headphones). We recommend you use a commercially available HD webcam for better video quality. Note that if you want to stream video output from external devices into Reacts (DVD, medical device, monitor, etc.) you will need to purchase a video converter (different types are commercially available).

**IS REACTS DIFFICULT TO USE AND HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO BECOME COMFORTABLE WITH ITS FUNCTIONALITIES?**

Despite the fact that Reacts has many functionalities, it is easy and intuitive to use. What is strongly recommended is for you to go through the variousonline tutorials that explain in details and step by step how to use the various functionalities of the platform. You should be fairly comfortable with the platform right after your first session!

**HOW MUCH BANDWIDTH DOES REACTS REQUIRE?**

In peer to peer mode Reacts require a minimum bandwidth of 0.75 Mbit/s per video stream. For example a standard peer to peer call where both users have a single web camera Reacts will require 0.75 Mbit/s Upload and 0.75 Mbit/s download. Every additional video stream received will require an additional 0.75 Mbit/s download and every additional video stream sent will require an additional 0.75 Mbit/s upload. For example a call with 6 total users, each with one camera, each user will need 4.5 Mbit/s Download and 0.75 Mbit/s upload. Reacts will automatically turn off your web cam when your upload speed is below 0.15 Mbit/s for more than 30 seconds.

**IS REACTS EASY TO IMPLEMENT AND MANAGE IN AN INSTITUTION?**
