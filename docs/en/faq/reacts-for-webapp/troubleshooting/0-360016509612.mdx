**Please note that NONE of your Reacts user information or communication is saved.**

Unfortunately, sometimes after the updates of the web application, caching can cause unexpected problems (for example: not able to perform some actions, missing information).

If you encounter this behavior, please :
-----------------------------------------

1.  Log in to Reacts web app
2.  Once on the home page press CTRL+SHIFT+R (at the same time)
3.  Reacts Web App will get re-loaded
