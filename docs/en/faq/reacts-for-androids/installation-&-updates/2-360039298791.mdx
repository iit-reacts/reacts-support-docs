Please note that it is possible that application updates are done automatically on your Android device. In which case, you can continue to use Reacts without interruptions.

If that is not the case, here are the steps to update your application manually:

1.  Open Reacts  
      
    
2.  Login on Reacts: a new “Login failed” window will open  
      
    
3.  Tap on the “Download Reacts” button:
