If you are getting «Cannot connect to server» or "Could not load file assembly "Name".dll" or one of its dependencies."error messages with your latest Reacts installation, issue might be caused by a missing or outdated Microsoft Windows components called**Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013 and Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2019 or more:**

To solve the problem go to the Windows Start Menu, click on Control Panel, Click on Programs and Features and find:

**"Microsoft Visual C ++ 2013 Redistributable (x64)/(x86) ..."** or **"Microsoft Visual C ++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013"**

**"Microsoft Visual C ++ 2019 Redistributable (x64)/(x86) ..."** or **"Microsoft Visual C ++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2019"**

Once you’ve found the Microsoft Redistributable, Right click on it and choose "Change" and then "Repair", this should repair the component. Close and re-open Reacts, you should be able to connect now.
