title: Troubleshooting Reacts installation

**User installation**

The end user installer of Reacts comes in an executable called “Setup.exe” that performs the check and installation of Reacts Prerequisites, as well as performing the version validation and other tasks that may be needed prior to the installation of the application.

**Note: Reacts requires elevated rights to install on the destination computer. Not having administrative rights on the local computer will make the installation fail.**

**Domain installation**

For Domain administrators it may be more convenient to use our Windows Installer (MSI) alternative. In that case, the domain administrators can preset the installation package for the domain which will grant the necessary rights to the installation package instead of having to grant access to the person installing. This is done by adding the MSI package “Reacts.msi” to the Software Installation Group policy in the domain.\*

_\* Refer to the documentation on Microsoft website in order to adapt it to your particular version and environment: [https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc753792(v=ws.11).aspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc753792(v=ws.11).aspx)_

**Note: As the msi package does not install any of the prerequisites, it is responsibility of the domain administrator to ensure that all prerequisites are available on the destination computer’s prior to the deployment of Reacts when using the .msi file**

**Prerequisites**

Below you can find the list of the prerequisites which are all Microsoft standard products that can be downloaded directly from Microsoft’s website.

 [.NET Framework (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net48-web-installer)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net48-web-installer)

[Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=40784)  (Please install X64 and X86 bit versions)

[Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable](https://www.microsoft.com/fr-ca/download/details.aspx?id=48145) (Please install X64 and X86 bit versions)

**Unattended install and encryption driver**

During installation, Reacts installs a virtual disk driver to allow the proper management of the local encryption for its documents. The installation usually prompts the user to install or don't install the driver. This driver is not installed by default when installing Reacts in unattended mode, however we strongly recommend the installation of the driver which will become default and even mandatory on future releases. Below are examples of how to bypass the prompt for the encryption driver installation:

 c:\\windows\\system32\\msiexec.exe /i path-to-reacts.msi /quiet /qn /norestart /log _path-to-install.log_ USECBFS=1

**c:\\windows\\system32\\msiexec.exe** - default path for the Windows installer

**/i path-to-reacts.msi** – normal installation of the file specified

**/quiet** - quiet mode (there is no user interaction)

**/qn** – no UI

**/norestart** -  the machine will not be restarted after the installation is complete

**/log  path-to-install.log** – output the installation log to the file specified

**USECBFS=1** – Install the encryption driver 

**INSTALLGIVECONTROL=0** – Do not install the _Allow giving control over shared display_ sub-feature

**INSTALLSHAREDISPLAY=0** – Do not install the _Allow sharing display_ or its sub-features

 i.e.:C:\\WINDOWS\\system32>msiexec /i c:\\temp\\reacts.msi /quiet /qn /norestart /log c:\\temp\\install.log USECBFS=1

 However, if the Eldos certificate was not previously accepted, Windows will pop up a security prompt similar to the following:

 ![](@assets/attachments/mceclip0.png)

The way to avoid this prompt is to install the EldoS certificate in the Trusted Publishers certificate store. You can download the [attached certificate](@assets/attachments/EldoS.cer). Install the downloaded certificate either manually or using a group policy.

 If you prefer to install the certificate as a user certificate, not as a computer certificate, make sure to use the same user that will run the installer.

 **To install the certificate via a group policy**

Open the Group Policy Management Editor

Edit the Group Policy Object you want to update or create a new one

Go to “Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Public Key Policies\\Trusted Publishers” and import the downloaded certificate there

Make sure your Group Policy Object is applied/updated to the group of computers/users that run Reacts

Once the certificate is installed, the Reacts Silent installer should work silently as expected.

**To install the certificate manually**

 Double click the downloaded certificate (the certificate import wizard will open)

Accept security warning pops up:

Once the certificate is installed, the Reacts Silent installer should work silently as expected.
