title: My Bluetooth speakerphone keeps getting disconnected during a session
---
If you are using a speakerphone connected via Bluetooth to your PC, tablet or mobile phone and it keeps disconnectingafter approximately 10-20 min into a Reacts session, please verify the following settings:

*   if your device is running on battery please verify your Power Savings settings;
*   verify Windows configuration for the Power Management of Bluetooth connections - make sure option: "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" is not chosen
*   make sure your Bluetooth speakers/microphone is fully charged
*   make sure that your device is compatible with Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) which is used by most Bluetooth devices todefine how multimedia audio can be streamed from one device to another over a Bluetooth connection.
