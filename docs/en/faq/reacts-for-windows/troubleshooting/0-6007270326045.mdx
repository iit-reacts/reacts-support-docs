**Troubleshooting connectivity issues**

Most connectivity issues are related to Network, Firewall and Filtering rules that are applied at the network and/or device level. If your local policies allow, **a** **simple test to rule out issues with your Reacts installation or device level rules is to use a public network to login.** If you can login to Reacts using a public network such as a mobile hotspot the connectivity issue stems from your a Network, Firewall and/or Filtering rules.

Here are basic trouble shooting steps to help you to fix some standard connectivity issues.

**Step 1:**Verify that your firewall and/or web filtering application settings allow Reacts to connect, from your web browser window try to access**[https://svc.iitreacts.com/api/echo](https://svc.iitreacts.com/api/echo).**

You should see a message similar to: «{"Reacts Version":"","Body":"Echo OK!","Type":"System.String","Time":"2016-07-27T15:04:59.6325394Z","Id":"676b0cf1-e3ad-4cb7-bb9d-6076e2913efc"}».

IF YOU DO NOT SEE A MESSAGE SIMILAR TO THE ONE ABOVE CONTINUE TO Steps 2 and 3

**Step 2:**Ensure that there is no interference between your antivirus software and Reacts that could prevent the software from being launched. Ensure that all IPs and Domains listed here [Reacts Installation Guide](({{ site.baseurl }}{% link en/onboarding/1-202719815.md %})) are whitelisted on your network.

IF YOU ARE STILL UNABLE TO CONNECT CONTINUE TO Steps 3

**Step 3:**Enter your proxy information. If you connect though a proxy, you may need to manually enter the proxy information into the Reacts settings panel.

1\. Launch Reacts and click on “Network settings” on the login screen.

2\. Select "Manual" to enter your proxy information.

3\. Click on "Re-log" Now
