You are trying to configure Audio/Video settings in Reacts but there is no microphone and/or speakers available from the drop down listwhen opening Audio/Video settings window:

Plus on Taskbar Windows sound icon shows red cross (no speaker or headphones are plugged in)![](@assets/attachments/sound_icon.png)**though you have speakers/microphone/headset/camera properly plugged in.**

This issue might be caused by a software drivers coming with some sound cards or audio/video devices (for example Beats, Realtek).

To resolve the issue please access Audio Manager Software that was installed with sound card or audio/video device and configure Audio/Video settings from there (for example setting your desired device as primary, removing any device that is not being used).

Close and re-open Reacts.
