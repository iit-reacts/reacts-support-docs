 **1\. Speakers / Output settings verification**

*   Make sure the volume of your playback device is turned up. You can test your selected playback device by clicking on the test button. 
*   If the Speaker / Output selector is empty, open the menu to select a playback device. If the menu doesn't contain a playback device verify your windows setting to make sure one is available on your machine (if needed, follow the document "AudioVideo settings - Windows 10").
*   If playback device is available on your machine and you still can't see it in the menu please log out and log back into Reacts.

**My counterpart do not see me**
--------------------------------

 **4. If you see your camera feed(s) but your counterpart do not see you**

*   Video connections/quality can be affected by the amount of bandwidth you have or the type of connection (land, wifi, 3G). Reacts require a minimum bandwidth of 0.75 Mbps. for the broadcast of a single video signal (2 Mbps optimal). For each additional camera added to a session, an additional 0.75 Mbps (minimal) to 1 Mbps (optimal) is required. Additional bandwidth is required when several functions are used at the same time (i.e. file transfer, screen sharing, etc.). In limited bandwidth situation, you should therefore try to limit the number of cameras connected and the number of concomitant functionalities used. Note that Reacts gives you the ability to manage bandwidth during the session (ie: you can hide your webcam(s) during a session to optimize bandwidth to other functionalities).
*   Try to switch between Face to Face and Session mode and see if your counterpart can see your camera feed(s), if your camera feed is visible in Session mode please to go Actions panel --> Settings then Audio/Video settings and verify which camera is selected for Face to Face mode
*   Right click on your camera thumbnail at the bottom of your screen and choose option Refresh

#### If the problem persists and everything is set up properly the problem could be with your counterpart settings- you may want to direct them to -"I do not see my counterpart" section below. 

**I do not see my counterpart**
-------------------------------

 **5\. Your counterpart sees their camera feed(s) but you do not see them**

*   Switch between Face to Face and Session mode
*   Right click on your counterpart's camera feed(s) at the top of the screen and choose option Refresh.
