title: Reacts Windows How to update your Reacts application when a new mandatory version is available 
---
Please note that the Windows version of the application possesses a silent updater, so it is highly probable that new versions are downloaded and installed without requiring further actions.  

In the eventuality that the application is not the newest updated version, here are the steps to follow:

1.  Login to Reacts
2.  Once in the Windows Reacts application: a “A new mandatory version of Reacts is available” window will open
      
    
3.  Click on the “Quit Reacts” button on said window :

4.  Wait fiveminutes
      
    
5.  Reopen Reacts.
6.  The update is now complete, and you can proceed to log in.
