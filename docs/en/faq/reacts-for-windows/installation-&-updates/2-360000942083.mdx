Description
===========

The_**Silent Update System**_is a Reacts mechanism designed to maintain the Reacts application up-to-date. The service allows_**Philips**_to deliver security and feature updates in a way that is fast, transparent, consistent, reliable and secure.

Process
=======

The _**Silent Update System**_ automatically downloads and prepares new versions of the Reacts application in the background. As soon as the user closes and re-opens the Reacts application, the latest version is launched. The system has no impact on the end-user: the updates are applied without generating any interruption whatsoever.

Delivery Frequency
==================

Clients that subscribe to the**_Fastlane_**will receive Reacts updates as soon as they are stable and released to the public. Clients that subscribe to the_**Fastlane**_will benefit from the most up-to-date security and features.

Clients subscribe to the**_Fastlane_**automatically during the normal installation of the application.
