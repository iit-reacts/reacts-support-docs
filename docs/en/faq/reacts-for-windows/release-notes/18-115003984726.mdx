New in the Contacts panel: instant messaging shortcut and video calls icon
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have made some changes to the Contacts panel in order to render the interface even simpler and more user-friendly.

We have added an instant messaging icon that allows you to send a message directly from the Contacts panel. You just have to click on the icon to start or continue a conversation with your contacts.

The old "Connection" button, used to launch a video call in peer-to-peer mode, has been replaced by the video call icon. From now on, just click this icon to start your video call.

**Automatic video stream shutdown in low bandwidth situations**

To optimize the user experience, we have added algorithms which analyze the quality of the bandwidth available to each user during peer-to-peer sessions. If the bandwidth drops below a critical threshold that does not allow an adequate video stream transmission, Reacts automatically turns off the video stream of the user with inadequate bandwidth while maintaining their audio communication.
