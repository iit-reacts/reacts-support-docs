**Local Encryption**

For extra security your Reacts content can now be encrypted on your device. If you want this feature, click on “I want local encryption ” during the installation process. You will then be asked to install the EldoS Corporation device software which is required to enable the Reacts local encryption.

**"Pro" and "Guest" licenses identified in your Contacts panel**

We have added labels in your Contacts panel to allow you to better identify those with "Pro" or "Guest" licenses. "Standard" license users don’t have a specific label.

**Audio / Video fixes**

*   Stream quality recovery mechanism
*   Intermittent stream rendering issue   
*   A/V setting panel resizing issue
