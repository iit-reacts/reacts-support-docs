#### **Watch video tutorials:[How to create scenes and presentations: Create scenes / Prepare and save a session / Open a saved session / How to do a live presentation of your saved session to a contact (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm8MnqTx4Bo)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm8MnqTx4Bo)**

You have multiple options to start a session:

1.  Go to _**Sessions**_ --> _**Start Now**_ --> _**New Session**_. From Main Session Interface choose the option _**Connect**_ from _**Actions panel**_ or option _**Sessions**_ \--> _**Open**_ and open one of your saved sessions.
2.  You can also use your previously saved session: go to _**Sessions**_ --> _**Start Now**_ --> _**Saved sessions**_ and choose from the list of your saved sessions, the one you want to open. When in the session, go to _**Actions panel**_, click on _**"Connect"**_ and choose user that you want to connect with from your _**Contacts list**_.

After you are connected with another user there are 2 modes: _**Face to Face**_ and _**Session mode**_.

In _**Face to Face**_ modeyou will have a camera input open on a screen so youcan have a discussion with your counterpart.

In _**Session mode**_ you can share your presentation, share app or desktop. To switch to _**Session mode**_, you would need to go to _**Actions panel**_ and choose option _**Begin Session**_. In _**Session mode**_ either a new Scene or a Scene from your previously saved presentation will open and you can start sharing your presentation.

To start or stop sharing you content with counterpart, on a _**Scene window**_ go to _**Menu bar**_ and choose option _**Share / Unshare**_:
