From Library you can access, sync and organize your assets, document, reports and checklists, import new ones. On the left side of Library window you have the side bar that allows you to navigate between different types of assets (images, video, 3D objects, snapshot galley) and document, checklists, reports and option to go back to the Home menu:

Now let's look closer at the top part of the window which is unified for all your assets and allows you to perform multiple actions.
