HOW TO ASSIGN GUEST SUBSCRIPTIONS WITH A CSV FILE
-------------------------------------------------

Our CSV file import feature allows you to assign multiple subscriptions at a time.  
Here is more information on how to format your file for the import:

### Creating a CSV document

To create a document in CSV format:  
\- open a new excel file  
\- save it by selecting the "CSV UTF-8" format

### Formatting your information in your CSV file

Your CSV document should contain the following information:

*   Column A of your CSV:
    *   Line 1: "First name"
    *   Line 2: the first name of the person to whom to assign the subscription

*   Column B of your CSV:
    *   Line 1: "Name"
    *   Line 2: the name of the person to whom to assign the subscription

*   Column C of your CSV:  
    o Line 1: "Email address"  
    o Line 2: the email address of the person to whom to assign the subscription

Then add a new row for each subscription you want to assign.  
**Important note:** The import of your CSV will only work if you respect the detailed format above.

HOW TO UNASSIGN A GUEST SUBSCRIPTION
