ASSIGNING SUBSCRIPTIONS
--------------------------

### 1\. Choose who owns the subscription.

You must specify whether your organization owns the Reacts account the subscription will be assigned to.  
  
Option A: Choose this option if you assign a subscription to an email that doesn't already have an account. (If the account already exists, it is owned by the account holder.)  
Note: If you need ownership of an account that is already owned by the account holder, please contact the Philips support  
  
Option B: Choose this option if you assign a subscription to an email that already has an account.  
Note: If you need ownership of an account that was assigned through option B, please contact the Philips support

**Important note:** We also recommend that you use our Add by CSV feature. Please read our tutorial about how to use a CSV if needed.

  
Once the subscription has been assigned, the user will receive an email informing them and asking them to finalize the creation of their account if they have not already done so.
