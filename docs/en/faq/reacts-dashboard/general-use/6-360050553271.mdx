*   Column B of your CSV :
    *   Line 1: "Email" 
    *   Line 2 :  The first name of the person to whom you want to assign a subscription

    *   Line 1: "First Name" 
    *   Line 2 : The last name of the person to whom you want to assign a subscription

*   Column D of your CSV : 
    *   Line 1: "Last Name"
