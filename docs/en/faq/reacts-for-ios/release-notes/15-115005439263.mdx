*   Optimization and bugs fixing
*   Automatic video stream shutdown in low bandwidth situations

To optimize the user experience, we have added algorithms which analyze the quality of the bandwidth available to each user during peer-to-peer sessions. If the bandwidth drops below a critical threshold that does not allow an adequate video stream transmission, Reacts automatically turns off the video stream of the user with inadequate bandwidth while maintaining their audio communication.
