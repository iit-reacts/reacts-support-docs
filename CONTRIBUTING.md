# Contributing to this Repository

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this Repository Template. Collaboration is one of our best tools to make a stronger Philips.

Feel welcome and read the following sections in order to know how to ask questions and how to work on something.

All members of our community are expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](./CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md). Please make sure you are welcoming and friendly in all of our spaces.

## Why a contribution guideline?

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the colleagues managing and developing this project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## Contributing

### Who can collaborate?

Anyone! :D

### How to collaborate?

There are three ways to collaborate:

1. Being part of the discussion in the open issues.
2. Opening an issue.
3. Sending a pull request.

### Support questions

1. Check the existing open issues
2. If there is any issue related to your question, open a new one.

> **Note**: Don't assign a label for your issue, this is a responsibility for the maintaners.

### Reporting issues

* Describe what you expected to happen.
* If possible, include a [minimal reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) to help us identify the issue. This also helps to check that the issue is not in your side.

### Sending pull requests

When contributing, your work should always be done in a branch off of your repo, this is also how you will submit your pull request when your work is done.

Each pull request should implement ONE feature or bugfix. If you want to add or fix more than one thing, submit more than one pull request.

> **Note**: Before you make a pull request, search the issues to see if a similar issue has already been submitted. If a similar issue has been submitted, ask to be assigned to the issue by posting a comment. If the issue does not exist, please make a new issue. Issues give us context about what you are contributing and expedite the process to getting your contributions merged.

Stay up to date with the activity in your pull request. Maintainers will be reviewing your work and making comments, asking questions and suggesting changes to be made before they merge your code.

Once all revisions to your pull request are complete, someone will squash and merge your commits for you.

## Responsibilities

* Follow our [Code of Conduct](./CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md).
* Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.
